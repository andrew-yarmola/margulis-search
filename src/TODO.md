* Implement tests
  * bounds for sin, cos elements to be between -1,1
  * cut off for cosh mu of 1.05
  * cut off for 0.8 for sinh dx and sinh dy
  * power of x or y moves 1j less than cosh mu
  * word w^k is identidy but w is not
  * word w moves axis(x) closers to axis(y) than dx + dy
  * word w moves axis(y) closers to axis(x) than dx + dy
  * word w moves axis(x) closer than 2 dx and w not power of x (including id)
  * word w moves axis(y) closer than 2 dy and w not powet of y (including id)
  * word w moves 1j less than mu
  * words w1 and w2 have margulis constant less than mu
