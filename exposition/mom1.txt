Dear Rob,

Here is the corrected version of the setup:


I'm planning to do a computerized search of parameter space.
The basic setup involves two parallel transformations (M and N), and one hyperbolic transformation (G)

Looking at the horoball picture:

We choose M and N so that B1' is in at most halfway, by flipping the signs of M and/or N.(this should be quite effective, since if I recall correctly some
of the most computationally difficult regions have symmetry, and we will save half (or even 3/4) of the compuational effort if a trouble region straddles one of the boundary lines)

The game is to find elements in the group generated by (M, N, G) which take B_infinity to a horoball larger than B1,
since this situation is either a contradiction, or an identity (modulo M N) in the group.

Numerically, the matrices are
M = [1, m, 0, 1]
N = [1, n + q i, 0, 1]
G = [i exp(-i theta/2) (g m + h (n + q i)), i exp(i theta/2), i exp(-i theta/2), 0]

We need to constrain the parameter space so as to eliminate symmetries and specify boundaries.

Given an arbitrary choice of M, N, and G, we can:
1. Rotate the picture so that M is on the positive real axis.
2. Subtract multiples of N from M to get -m/2 <= n <= m/2.
3. If length(N) < length(M), swap M and N and go back to step 1
4. Subtract multiples of N and M from G to get -1/2 <= g <= 1/2 and -1/2 <= h <= 1/2.
5. If g < 0, replace N with -N.
6. If h < 0, replace M with -M.
7. Finally, if q < 0, replace i with -i to make q > 0

Because M has been chosen to be the minimum translation, we know that m >= 1.
At this stage, we are interested in setups where the total area of the fundamental parallelogram is <= 4.

The boundaries of the relevant parameter space are then:

1 <= m  (horoball size)
-m/2 <= n <= m/2 (reduction modulo M)
m^2 <= q^2 + n^2 (M isn't longer than N)
0 <= g <= 1/2 (reduction modulo M, flipping sign of M)
0 <= h <= 1/2 (reduction module N, flipping sign of N)
q > 0 (complex conjugate symmetry)
m q <= 4 (area of fundamental parallelogram)
-pi <= theta <= pi (rotation of 2 pi == identity)

(note that I have dropped the constraint that m <= 1.5; I think it's mostly superfluous given that we are also insisting that m q < 4)
I think these parameters give us a compact parameter space.

I guess it might be better to use the constraint -1/2 <= n <= 1/2, and use m n in place of n; this way, if there is interesting stuff that happens when n == 1/2, we may be better placed to see it, and also better placed computationally (fewer cross terms)
